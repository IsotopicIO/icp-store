If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd isotopic_icp_store/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface, giving authorization to the provided principals
dfx deploy isotopic_icp_store_backend --argument '(record { owners = opt vec {principal "<principal 1>"; principal "<principal 2>"};})'
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.
